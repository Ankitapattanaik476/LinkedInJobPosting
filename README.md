This project implements a fully engineered machine-learning pipeline for salary prediction using the LinkedIn Job Postings dataset, integrating automated data ingestion, systematic null-value diagnostics, schema-level filtering, and median-based imputation for salary attributes to recover numerical consistency across incomplete records. High-noise unstructured attributes such as descriptions, skills text, and titles are removed to reduce dimensional sparsity, while categorical variables are entropy-compressed via LabelEncoder to enable efficient modeling. After feature refinement, an XGBoost Regressor is trained on a curated feature matrix representing job metadata including pay period, experience level, geographic identifiers, company attributes, and job-level behavioral signals, followed by evaluation using RMSE to quantify deviation between predicted and normalized salaries. The workflow concludes with an actual-vs-predicted diagnostic scatterplot to assess model variance, highlighting regression nonlinearity and informing future steps such as hyperparameter tuning, domain-aware feature engineering, and integration of NLP-derived semantic signals to improve predictive robustness.
